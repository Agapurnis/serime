# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of writing, there is no long term support for any previous versions of the library.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should be disclosed first to [agapurnis@outlook.com](mailto:agapurnis@outlook.com) and nowhere else.

After remediation and the sufficient passage of time, an issue will be filed for record-keeping purposes.

## Vulnerability Definition

The execution of user-provided code is not considered a vulnerability, but as this may be unwanted behavior for some,
the library can be configured to disallow this behavior (and is configured to do so by default).

A security vulnerability would be a way to bypass these preventative measures.
